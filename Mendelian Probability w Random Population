#Given: Three positive integers k, m, and n, representing a population containing k+m+n organisms: 
#    k individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, m are heterozygous, and n are homozygous recessive.
#Return: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing 
#    a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.

k = 22
m = 21
n = 18

probDominant = 1.0 - ((n*(n-1) + (m*n) + 0.25*m*(m-1))/((k+m+n)*(k+m+n-1)))
