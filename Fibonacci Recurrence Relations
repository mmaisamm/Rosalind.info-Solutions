# Given: Positive integers n≤40 and k≤5.
# Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, 
		every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).

#METHOD 1
k=3
n=35
a=1
b=1
for x in range(0,n-1):
	a,b=b,k*a+b
print(a)


#METHOD 2
def fib(n, k):
    previous1, previous2 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        previous1, previous2 = previous2, previous1 * k + previous2
    return previous2
